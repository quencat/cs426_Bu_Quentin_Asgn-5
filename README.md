Network game lighting and physics practice


This is a touch-up of a previous group assignment, the network game "A Digital Dogs Race".
The player is a digital dog navigating through the maze to find cats to compete with other players for the opportunity to become a real dog.
The touch-up focuses on environmental design and collision. The game area is retextured.


For the required components:
New physical construct 1: Border collision prevents falling and gives red warning when breached.
New physical construct 2: Particle explosion when collision with cat occurs.
New billboard texture: camera-facing cartoon bones create more absurdity for the story and some visual obstruction to confuse the players.
New lighting 1: All environmental light source and light settings have been replaced and adjusted. Including asset lightbox, directional light from below, spotlight that illuminate the players.
New lighting 2: Flashing purple and blue lights on the circuit board create a neon digital fantasy.
New sound 1: Bouncing sound when player collide with the maze wall.
New sound 2: Meowing sound when a cat is caught.
