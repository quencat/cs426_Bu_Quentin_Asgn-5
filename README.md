Network game lighting and physics practice


This is a touch-up of a previous group assignment, the network game "A Digital Dogs Race".<br/>
The player is a digital dog navigating through the maze to find cats to compete with other players for the opportunity to become a real dog.<br/>
The touch-up focuses on environmental design and collision. The game area is retextured.<br/>


For the required components:<br/>
New physical construct 1: Border collision prevents falling and gives red warning when breached.<br/>
New physical construct 2: Particle explosion when collision with cat occurs.<br/>
New billboard texture: camera-facing cartoon bones create more absurdity for the story and some visual obstruction to confuse the players.<br/>
New lighting 1: All environmental light source and light settings have been replaced and adjusted. Including asset lightbox, directional light from below, spotlight that illuminate the players.<br/>
New lighting 2: Flashing purple and blue lights on the circuit board create a neon digital fantasy.<br/>
New sound 1: Bouncing sound when player collide with the maze wall.<br/>
New sound 2: Meowing sound when a cat is caught.
